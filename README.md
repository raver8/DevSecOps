# DevSecOps on AKS

A deep dive into integrating security practices into Azure Kubernetes Service workflows.

## Agile Principles

The Agile Manifesto's core principles still resonate. These promote adaptive planning and continuous improvement.

## Methodologies

- LEAN
- SAFe
- SCRUM
- XP
- KANBAN
- Feature Driven Development

## Common Challenges

- Accountability gaps
- Too Many Rituals
- Scope Creep
- Quality Testing is an Afterthought
- Security as a Blackbox

## Compliance Frameworks vs. Regulations

- Frameworks are guidelines for best practices.
  - NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0
  - AI Risk Management Framework
- Regulations are mandatory legal requirements.
  - U.S. FFIEC
  - EU GDPR
  - EU AI ACT
  - EU DORA
  - U.S. HIPAA

## Audit vs. Assessment: Key Differences

- Audit
  - Formal & structured
  - Independent
  - Compliance-focused
  - Risk-oriented
  - Provides assurance and recommendations for improvement.
- Assessment
  - Flexible & adaptable
  - Internal or external
  - Focus on improvement
  - May not be compliance-driven
  - Offers insights into IT optimization and alignment.

## Governance in SOx 404

- Access Control
- IT Security
- Data Backup & Recovery
- Change Management
- Testing Internal Controls
- Documentation

SOx 404 governance mandates stringent controls. Areas include access control, IT security, data handling, and testing.

## NIST CSF 2.0 KPIs

- Risk Management
  - Identified vulnerabilities
  - Risk assessment coverage
  - Mitigation controls
- Incident Response
  - Mean time to detect
  - Mean time to respond
  - Incidents handled
- Business Continuity
  - Recovery Time Objective
  - Recovery Point Objective
  - DR test success rate

KPIs measure the effectiveness of controls. Focus areas are risk, response, and recovery.

## DevSecOps Lifecycle

1. Planning: Define goals, requirements, and security considerations.
2. Coding: Developers write secure code.
3. Build: Integrate security scans.
4. Test: Automated security tests are run.
5. Release: Code is prepared for deployment with compliance checks.
6. Deploy: Applications are deployed securely.
7. Operate: Application runs with continuous monitoring.

Security is integrated into every phase. From planning to operation, it's a continuous loop.

## DevSecOps on AKS

- Secure Configuration: Harden AKS clusters using CIS benchmarks and Azure Security Center.
- Identity and Access: Implement RBAC and integrate with Azure AD for authentication.
- Network Security: Use Network Policies and Azure Firewall for traffic control.
- Monitoring and Logging: Collect and analyze security logs with Azure Monitor and Sentinel.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography on Azure

- FIPS 205: SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+)
- FIPS 204: ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium)
- FIPS 203: ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber)

Azure is preparing for post-quantum threats. It is adopting new cryptographic standards.


## Key Takeaways

- Shift-Left Security: Integrate security early in the development lifecycle.
- Automate Compliance: Use tools to automate security checks and reporting.
- Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor and improve security posture.

DevSecOps on AKS ensures security and compliance. It automates processes and improves continuously.
